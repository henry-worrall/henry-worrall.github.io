      <p>
        In 2018, I graduated with a first-class master's degree in natural sciences, specialising in physics and mathematics, from the University of Leeds. During my master's year, I undertook a detailed research project into liquid crystal dispersions, where I studied the behaviour of novel discotic liquid crystals and graphene oxide platelets. Through this experience, I gained plenty of analytical and research skills which complemented my lectures. Additionally, I have experience working as a patent attorney, where I provided legal advice to well-known, international companies, where I helped to secure legal protection for their novel scientific inventions.

        I am currently working towards a job in software, either as a developer or as a data scientist. To aid this mission, I have completed online courses and projects. My projects can be found on <a href="https://github.com/henry-worrall/">my GitHub profile</a>. Please have a look and let me know your thoughts!

      <h4>
        Tableau COVID-19 Dashboard - (<a href="https://public.tableau.com/profile/henry.worrall#!/vizhome/COVID-19DashboardAnalysis/COVID-19Dashboard">view</a>)
      </h4>

      <p>
        Amidst the panic of lockdown, I found myself looking to develop new skills and experiment with different ways of visualising data. One software platform which kept appearing in job descriptions was "Tableau". After stumbling across a blog post containing a link to Johns Hopkins CSSE's COVID-19 data, I decided it was time to make my first dashboard. Using Tableau as my design platform, I jumped inâ€¦

      <p>
        The first hurdle that I had to overcome was to sync my live data source with Tableau. Unfortunately, syncing a live data source to Tableau is not something that is covered in most beginner Tableau tutorials (I couldn't find any at least!). I eventually got over this hurdle by spotting that I could link my free version of Tableau to a Google Spreadsheet. I decided that this was my best bet and started about finding a way of automatically getting my data into an online Google Sheet which could then connect to Tableau. Writing a Python script to automatically download the data was simple enough. I then needed to reform the data into an easy to process format - I used the pandas library for this. The next step was to get my head around the security protocols of Google's APIs so that I could automatically save the reformated data online (thankfully, there were tutorials for this step!). For completeness and to fully automate the process, I used the windows task scheduler to run the script every day.
      </p>

        I began visualising the data and designing the dashbaord. In my experience, I found Tableau is fantastic for making nice visualisations quickly, with extensive features for formatting. However, it was infuriating at times. Tables were clearly not what the software was designed for, and getting some basic features to work was a lot of effort - for example, I couldn't get the ranking function to work on a calculated field and had to write my own just to get around this! But overall, I was happy with my Tableau dashboarding experience, the finished product, and the analysis and insights one can gain from using it.

        During this project, I also learnt to web-scrape data using the Python beautiful soup library. I needed to do this to obtain additional information about each country, e.g. population, and GDP. This allows a user to draw insights about the virus relative to a country's population and wealth.
