<p>I graduated with a first-class master's degree in natural sciences from the University of Leeds where I specialised in physics and mathematics. In my master's year, I undertook a detailed research project into liquid crystal dispersions, where I studied the behaviour of novel discotic liquid crystals and graphene oxide platelets. Through this, I gained both practical lab-based research skills and analytical-based research to supplement the advanced quantitative knowledge I learnt during university lectures. Additionally, I have experience working a patent attorney, where I provided legal advice to well-known international companies to help protect their novel scientific inventions.</p>
<p>I am currently working towards a job in software either as a developer or as a data scientist. To aid this mission, I have completed online courses and completed projects which are displayed through GitHub on this website. Please feel free to take a look, and if you like, let me know your thoughts! All feedback is welcomed.</p>
